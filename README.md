Neural Collaborative Filtering with PyTorch in C++

Algorithms used in this repository are based on the following paper:

Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua (2017). [Neural Collaborative Filtering.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3052569) In Proceedings of WWW '17, Perth, Australia, April 03-07, 2017.

You can find an implemenation by the authors of the paper in Python [here](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_collaborative_filtering)

## Why in C++?
It is probably better to use Python for ML/DL related tasks, because of its easy to use APIs, but integration into already existing C++ code-bases can sometimes be tricky.
